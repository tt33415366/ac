# ac
another candidate for apache benchmark  
Though it had a very loud name, it might be just a hope, I may not finish it untill I've got another long vacation.  
Still, hope this little project might be helpful for someone who are new to **_epoll/select_** and **_pthread_**.  

N.B. _A manually timeout is **REQUIRED**, since the default timeout of the system is too large for a load benchmark._
